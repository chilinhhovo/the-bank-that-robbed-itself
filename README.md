# Goal 
To understand Vietnam's financial system 
Learn to translate complex ideas from Vietnamese to English
How to humanise big numbers 
This is one of the rare cases from Vietnam that has been covered globally due to its size of impact however, not many people has explained the details of how. This is my attempt to take a lot of qualitiative data and turn them into understandtable graphics/ concepts. 

# Final output 
Timeline, charts, map (maybe?) 

# Design stack used:
- HTML + CSS 
- Google Sheets
- Datawrapper 
- Illustrator 
- Photoshop

# Process summary
1. I found and read more than 100 articles on the case, from state newspapers, to global newspapers like Bloomberg, Reuters, to comments on social media to understand what's happening
2. Collated information and tried to make sense of the timeline
3. Tried to collect data which was very difficult, because it's an ongoing case and the number was so big it shook the country so state media stopped publishing numebers with fear of destablizing the nation
4. Interviewed Dr Linh Nguyen, Associate Professor of Banking and Finance, Former Head of Treasury of Saigonbank, who specliased in interbank transactions and corporate governance
5. Sketched various versions of the ecosystems, timeline and graphs
6. Finding the narrative, focusing on the driver for cash withdrawal or properties or general case?
7. Storyline established and revised quotes
8. Created charts, graphs, building illustrations, map using Illustrator, Datawrapper and Photoshop

# Findings
1. $44B Fraud: Truong My Lan orchestrated Vietnam’s largest financial fraud over 11 years, primarily through Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB).
2. SCB Takeover: Merged three struggling banks in 2011 to create SCB, which she controlled for fraudulent loans.
3. 93% Loan Fraud: Over 2,500 fraudulent loans, amounting to 93% of SCB’s total lending, funneled to shell companies.
4. Van Thinh Phat’s Ecosystem: Included real estate, financial institutions, ghost companies, and offshore entities to launder money.
5. Real Estate Empire: Used high-value properties (Times Square Saigon, Union Square, etc.) as collateral for loans and money laundering.
6. Bond Manipulation: An Dong Investment Group repurchased bonds from Van Thinh Phat to hide financial instability.
7. Cash Withdrawals: Over $4 billion in cash withdrawn from SCB and stored in her properties.
8. Regulatory Bribery: Paid $5M bribe to Central Bank officials to cover up violations.
9. Legal Fallout: In April 2024, Truong My Lan got death sentencing. This is the first private businessperson in Vietnam to face capital punishment for financial crimes.

# Lesson learned: 
- Quantitative data in Vietnam is difficult to dig
- This is an ongoing case, and I learned a lot of financial concepts but it was very difficult, a lot of overthinking happened
- Difficult to visualize when there's no data
- Really challenged ability to condense and transform concepts into visuals
- Animation using code was very difficult so I gave up and did the static map instead
- Tried ai2html to make responsive web by following Soma's stardom youtube channel but fonts did not work properly and ran out of time so I will give more time to learn this skill in the next project
